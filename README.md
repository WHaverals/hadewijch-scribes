## Hadewijch's oeuvre

The oeuvre of the medieval mystic Hadewijch (13th century) has been fully preserved in three manuscripts, commonly referred to as 'A', 'B' and 'C', with A and B being the two oldest Hadewijch manuscripts:

- Manuscript A is dated in the first half of the fourteenth century, more specifically 1325-1350. Previous research has shown that three scribes were responsible for copying the text. 

- Manuscript B is dated around 1380. The consensus is that the scribe responsible for copying Ms. B used Ms. A as an exemplar.

With Ms. B being, supposedly, a direct copy of Ms. A, we have a very rare case in Middle Dutch philology.

In terms of content, mss. A and B contain the same texts. Also the order of texts is preserved:

1. Letters
2. Visions
3. Songs
4. Poems
(5. Ms. B also contains additional poems at the end, which are not considered part of Hadewijch's oeuvre)
